# Midi_from_wav-beta-version-
Extracts notes from a .wav file, with the ultimate purpose of creating a piano midi file.

Uses Normalizer, a .py file used in my Audio_Potential project.
To execute, open Note_Extractor il your favorite python editor and execute the script.
Since this is a beta, you will need to manually change the name of the file you want to run it on in the function compress function (fourth-to-last line of code).
Change nothing else, and when you execute the script, your output midi file will be generated. It's name will be new_sound.mid.
