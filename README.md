# Midi_from_wav-beta-version-
Extracts notes from a .wav file, with the ultimate purpose of creating a piano midi file.
This is a beta version. It will eventually be used to generate midi. Currently prints list of all notes played at each point in time (which can easily be turned into midi messages).
the number of samples in a time step, as well as the level of tolerance for discarding noise ; need to be specified when the function is called.
Uses Normalizer, a .py file used in my Audio_Potential project.
